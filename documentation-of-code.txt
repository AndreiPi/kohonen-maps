Code consists of:

class GSOM_Node 		- which initializes nodes with weights, no neighbouring nodes, and iterations
				- method adjust_weights which updates weights according to formula on the wiki page (refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_self-organizing_map )
				- method is_boundary which checks if the node is at boundary of map, and returns boolean value


method _distance 		- takes a matrix and it's weights as inputs
		 		- returns summation of squares of differences of input values. used by _find_bmu

method _find_bmu 		- takes a matrix as input
		 		- returns the winning node, that is, node having minimum distance

method _find_similar_boundary   - takes a node as input and returns a node with similar boundary, or False

method _grow			- the winning node is provided as input
				- the node inserts a node in all 4 possible directions if it does not exist
				- returns entire list of nodes
